\usage{
fitlm_dagum(x, ignore_zeros = FALSE, zero_threshold = 0.01, order = c(1:5))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A xts object containing the time series data.}

\item{ignore_zeros}{A logical value, if TRUE zeros will be ignored. Default is FALSE.}

\item{zero_threshold}{The threshold below which values are considered zero. Default is 0.01.}

\item{order}{Vector: The order of moments to the be matched. Can be discontinuous, e.g. 2,3,4}
}
\description{
Function for fitting the Dagum distribution using the L-Moments method.
Since there is not closed expression for the L-Moments of this distribution, the fitting must be done numerically.
For this purpose we employ the lmom::pelp function which works by optimization and requires an initial set of parameters.
